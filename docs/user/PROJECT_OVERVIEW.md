# ArrPy: The Complete Educational Array Computing Library

## 🎯 Project Achievement

ArrPy successfully demonstrates the complete journey of building a high-performance numerical computing library from scratch, progressing from simple Python to SIMD-optimized C++ while maintaining educational clarity throughout.

## 📚 What Makes ArrPy Special

### 1. **Three-Backend Architecture**
Unlike other libraries that hide their implementation, ArrPy exposes three complete implementations that you can switch between at runtime:

```python
arrpy.set_backend('python')  # See the algorithms
arrpy.set_backend('cython')  # Learn optimization
arrpy.set_backend('c')       # Achieve performance
```

### 2. **Educational Transparency**
Every algorithm is implemented clearly without hidden complexity:
- Python backend shows the mathematical concepts
- Cython backend demonstrates type optimization
- C++ backend reveals SIMD and cache optimization

### 3. **Complete NumPy Compatibility**
Over 100 operations implemented across:
- Array creation and manipulation
- Broadcasting and indexing
- Linear algebra (LU, QR, SVD, eigenvalues)
- FFT and signal processing
- Statistical functions
- I/O operations

```

### Key Design Decisions

1. **No Automatic Fallbacks**: Explicit control over performance vs functionality
2. **Flat Memory Layout**: Row-major ordering for cache efficiency
3. **Broadcasting Without Copies**: Stride manipulation for memory efficiency
4. **SIMD Where Beneficial**: Selective vectorization for maximum impact
