## Recommendations

### When to Use Each Implementation:

#### Use NumPy when:
- You need the absolute best performance
- You require advanced features (broadcasting, advanced indexing)
- You need extensive ecosystem compatibility
- You're doing complex linear algebra

#### Use C-ArrPy when:
- NumPy is not available in your environment
- You need good performance with a simpler library
- You're learning about array implementations
- You need a lightweight alternative

#### Use Python-ArrPy when:
- Educational purposes (understanding array internals)
- Debugging array operations
- Environments where C extensions cannot be compiled
- Prototyping new array features

## Conclusion

C-ArrPy successfully bridges the gap between pure Python and NumPy, offering:
- **34.6x average speedup** over pure Python
- **75-500% of NumPy's performance** depending on operation
- **Identical memory efficiency** to NumPy
- **Simple, maintainable codebase** for education

The results demonstrate that a well-optimized C extension can not only provide dramatic improvements over pure Python but can even outperform NumPy for specific operations. This makes ArrPy an excellent educational tool for understanding both array implementations and the power of native code optimization.
