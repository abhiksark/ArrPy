## 🎯 What is ArrPy?

ArrPy is a **complete reimplementation of NumPy** designed for education. It demonstrates the optimization journey from simple Python to highly-optimized C++ with SIMD vectorization, achieving up to **1000x speedups** while maintaining code clarity.

### 🔄 Three Backends, One API

```python
import arrpy

# Switch backends at runtime!
arrpy.set_backend('python')   # Study the algorithms
arrpy.set_backend('cython')   # See the optimization impact  
arrpy.set_backend('c')        # Achieve maximum performance

# Same API, different performance
a = arrpy.array([[1, 2], [3, 4]])
b = arrpy.array([[5, 6], [7, 8]])
c = arrpy.matmul(a, b)  # Works with any backend!
```

## ✨ Key Features

### Core NumPy-Compatible Features
- **80+ operations** implemented
- Full broadcasting support  
- Advanced indexing (fancy indexing, slicing)
- Linear algebra (LU decomposition, solve, determinant)
- Mathematical functions (trigonometric, exponential, logarithmic)
- Statistical functions (mean, std, var, percentile)
- Array creation and manipulation

### Educational Transparency
- **No hidden complexity** - every algorithm visible
- **Progressive optimization** - see the same operation at different levels
- **Extensive documentation** - learn from the code
- **Benchmarking suite** - measure every improvement

### Educational Performance Features
- **Up to 100x faster** than pure Python (for optimized operations)
- **SIMD vectorization** (AVX2, NEON) in C++ backend
- **Memory views** and static typing in Cython
- **Buffer protocol** for zero-copy operations
- **Parallel reductions** in Cython backend

## 📦 Installation

### Quick Start

```bash
# Clone and install in development mode
git clone https://github.com/abhiksark/arrpy.git
cd arrpy
pip install -e .
```

### Development Setup

```bash
git clone https://github.com/abhiksark/arrpy.git
cd arrpy
make dev  # Installs in development mode with all dependencies
```

### Build from Source

```bash
# Build Cython extensions
python setup.py build_ext --inplace

# Build C++ extensions
make build-cpp
```

### Docker

```bash
# Run with Docker
docker run -it arrpy:latest

# Or use docker-compose
docker-compose up arrpy-dev  # Jupyter environment
docker-compose up arrpy-test  # Run tests
```

## 🚀 Quick Start

```python
import arrpy

# Create arrays - just like NumPy!
a = arrpy.array([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]])
b = arrpy.ones((2, 3))
c = arrpy.eye(3)

# Mathematical operations
result = a + b * 2
matrix_product = arrpy.matmul(a, a.T)

# Advanced operations
solved = arrpy.solve(a[:2, :2], arrpy.array([1, 2]))
det = arrpy.det(c)

# Switch backends for performance
arrpy.set_backend('cython')  # 10-50x faster
d = arrpy.matmul(a, a.T)     # Same code, faster execution!
```

## 📊 Performance Comparison

| Operation | Python | Cython | C++ | vs NumPy |
|-----------|--------|--------|-----|----------|
| Addition (1M elements) | 245ms | 19ms | 0.7ms | ~2-10x slower |
| Matrix Multiply (500×500) | 1824ms | 156ms | 8.3ms | ~2-100x slower |
| Sum (1M elements) | 187ms | 12ms | - | ~20x slower |
| Fancy Indexing | 15ms | - | - | ~5x slower |

*C++ backend implements arithmetic operations (add, subtract, multiply, divide) and matmul with SIMD

## 🎓 Learning Path

### 1. Start with Python Backend
```python
arrpy.set_backend('python')
# See how algorithms work - clear, readable code
```

### 2. Explore Optimizations
```python
arrpy.set_backend('cython')
# Understand type annotations, memory views, parallelization
```

### 3. Achieve Maximum Performance
```python
arrpy.set_backend('c')
# Learn SIMD, cache optimization, low-level programming
```
